Cubic Splines, Simple Filters, Numerical Differentiation, and Integration

Analyze discrete data from a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR) 

The program fits a natrual cubic spline to the data and apply either 
a box car average filter or a Savitzky-Golay filter to the point before fitting.
